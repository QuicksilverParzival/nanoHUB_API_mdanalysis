# nanoHUB_API_mdanalysis
This repo contains an amalgamate of code allowing
for the mdanalysis tool to be called via Jupyter.
Some edits had to be made to the nanoHUB remote
so the nanoHUB_remote folder here is unique.
Also only graphs can properly be output at this
time.

# mysecrets.py
Also note that a mysecrets.py file needs to be
made and added to this directory for the code to
work.
